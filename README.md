# OUP-M
Source for OUP/M - a CP/M-like operating system for 6502

My goal is to compile a binary for emulation.

From the original:
"In the development of OUP/M, an OSI C-3 microcomputer system was used. This system consists of a 6502 CPU, a dual 8-inch floppy disk drive, a console, a printer, and 56 K bytes of RAM. On this machine all I/O is memory mapped and address space layout has to be taken into consideration."
